This shou	ld line up wi	th the bars ab	ove

This is a test line with lots of spaces         

This one will have	tabs			

This line should be the same 

There should be nothing between these lines

This line needs to have a bunch of characters in it. Like, more than 80. Unfortunately, I don't know how I'm 
going to make up that many characters. Maybe I'll write a poem. Roses are red, violets are blue,
this keyboard is loud, but what can you do?
