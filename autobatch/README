There's a problem at work where we need to make batch requests to this remote system, but we'd love to just ignore that and make them one by one. I have this idea that we can have a future-powered system where we make the individual calls in threads and some background system batches up all the individual calls into a single batch, makes the single batch request, and then gives all the individual threads the data they asked for as though they made individual requests. We'll see how that goes.
