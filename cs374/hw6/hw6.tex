\begin{quote}
The McKing chain wants to open several restaurants along Red
  street in Shampoo-Banana. The possible locations are at $L_1,L_2,
  \ldots, L_n$ where $L_i$ is at distance $m_i$ meters from the start
  of Red street. Assume that the street is a straight line and the
  locations are in increasing order of distance from the starting
  point (thus $0 \leq m_1 < m_2 < \ldots < m_n$). McKing has collected
  some data indicating that opening a restaurant at location $L_i$
  will yield a profit of $p_i$ independent of where the other
  restaurants are located. However, the city of Shampoo-Banana has a
  zoning law which requires that any two McKing locations should be
  $D$ or more meters apart. {\em In addition McKing does not want to
    open more than $k$ restaurants due to budget constraints.}
  Describe an algorithm that McKing can use to figure out the maximum
  profit it can obtain by opening restaurants while satisfying the
  city's zoning law and the constraint of opening at most $k$
  restaurants.  Your algorithm should use only $O(n)$ space and you
  should not assume that $k$ is a constant.

\begin{solution}
    First, let's define a \emph{next}(x) function that gives you the index of the closest location to x that is greater than x.
    Now let's define our recurrence
    \[
    MP(i, 0) = 0
    \]
\[
    MP(i > n, k) = 0
    \]
\[
    MP(i, k) = max(MP(\emph{next}(i + d), k - 1), MP(i + 1, k))
    \]

    Note that this BinarySearch returns the leftmost element that is greater than or equal to the "needle" input
    \begin{algo}
        MaxMoney(L[1..n], k, d) \+
        L[n + 1] = $\infty$
        \\ k = [0] * n // k is the k we're at 
        \\ km = [0] * n // km is our k - 1 
        \\ k[n + 1] = km[n + 1] = 0
        \\ currK = 1 // we'll get 0 for everything if k = 0, so we start with 
        \\ // our k tracking k = 1
        \\ while currK <= k \+
        \\ for i $\gets$ n $\ldots$ 1 \+
        \\ next = BinarySearch($L$, $L_i + d$)
        \\ k[i] = max(km[next], k[i + 1]) \-
        \\ currK++
        \\ km = k \-
        \\ return km[0]
    \end{algo}
\end{solution}

\begin{quote}
Let $X = x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_r$, $Y = y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_s$ and $Z =
  z_1,z_2,\ldots,z_t$ be three sequences. A common {\em supersequence}
  of $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ is another sequence $W$ such that $X$, $Y$ and $Z$
  are subsequences of $W$. Suppose $X = a,b,d,c$ and $Y = b,a,b,e,d$ and $Z =
  b, e, d, c$. A simple common supersequence of $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ is
  the concatenation of $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ which is
  $a,b,d,c,b,a,b,e,d,b,e,d,c$ and has length $13$. A shorter one is
  $b, a, b, e, d, c$ which has length $6$.  Describe an efficient
  algorithm to compute the {\em length} of the shortest common
  supersequence of three given sequences $X$, $Y$ and $Z$. You may want to
  first solve the two sequence problem to get you strated.
\end{quote}

\begin{solution}
    Our recurrence finds the shortest common superstring of x[i..n], y[j..n], and z[j..n]. 
    MS(i, j, k) = $\infty$ if i > n or j > n or k > n
    MS(i, j, k) = 1 + MS(i + 1, j + 1, k) if x[i] = y[j]
    MS(i, j, k) = 1 + min(MS(i + 1, j, k + 1), MS(i, j + 1, k)) if x[i] = z[k]
    MS(i, j, k) = 1 + min(MS(i, j + 1, k + 1), MS(i + 1, j, k)) if y[j] = z[k]
    MS(i, j, k) = 1 + MS(i + 1, j + 1, k + 1) if x[i] = y[j] = z[k]
    MS(i, j, k) = 1 + min(MS(i + 1, j, k), MS(i, j + 1, k), MS(i, j, k + 1)) if x[i], y[j], z[k] distinct
    3-d array and I think we're done.

\begin{quote}
Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ a matching is a subset of edges in $G$
  that do not \emph{intersect}. More formally $M \subseteq E$ is a
  matching if every vertex $v \in V$ is incident to at most one edge
  in $M$. Matchings are of fundamental importance in combinatorial
  optimization and have many applications. Given $G$ and non-negative
  weights $w(e), e \in E$ on the edges one can find the maximum weight
  matching in a graph in polynomial time but the algorithm requires
  advanced machinery and is beyond the scope of this course. However,
  finding the maximum weight matching in a tree is easier via dynamic
  programming. 
\end{quote}
\hrule



\begin{solution}
    I think this is trivial. At any root, you can take the edge to one of it's children, or neither. If you take neither, recurse on children. If you take one, recurse on the taken one's grandchildren and the taken one's children. I think.
\end{solution}
