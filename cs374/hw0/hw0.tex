\begin{quote}
    Suppose $S$ is a set of 103 integers. Prove that there is a subset $S' \subseteq S$ of at least 15 numbers such that the difference of any two numbers in $S'$ is a multiple of 7.
\end{quote}
\hrule



\begin{solution}
    First, let's prove that every pair of numbers in $S$ that are equal mod 7 have a difference that is a multiple of 7. \\
    Let a and b be integers, where $a = 7n + c\text{ and }b = 7m + c$. m, n, and c are also integers. Therefore, $a - b = (7n + c) - (7m + c) = 7(n - m)$. Since $n, m \in \mathbb{Z}$, also $(n - m) \in \mathbb{Z}$. Thus, their difference is a multiple of 7. \\
    Let's also note that, mod 7, numbers can only take 7 possible values, 0-6 inclusive. If we divide the 103 numbers from $S$ into those 7 sets, we will have 7 sets of numbers such that any pair of numbers from the same set has a difference that is a multiple of 7. Furthermore, by dividing 103 numbers into 7 sets, we know by the pigeonhole principle that at least one set has to have 15 or more elements, since $103 \div 7 > 14$.
\end{solution}
