\begin{quote}
Graphs are a powerful tool to model many phenomena.  The edges
  of a graph model pairwise relationships. It is natural to consider
  higher order relationships.  Indeed {\em hypergraphs} provide one
  such modeling tool.  A hypergraph $G=(V,\mathcal{E})$ consists of a
  finite set of nodes/vertices $V$ and a finite set of hyper-edges
  $\mathcal{E}$. A hyperedge $e \in \mathcal{E}$ is simply a subset of
  nodes and the cardinality of the subset can be larger than two. An
  undirected graph is a hypergraph where each hyper-edge is of size
  exactly two. Here is an example. $V=\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ and $\mathcal{E}
  = \{\{1,2\},\{2,3,4\},\{1,3,4,5\},\{2,5\}\}$. The representation
  size of a hypergraph is $|V| + \sum_{e \in \mathcal{E}} |e|$.  An
  alternating sequence of nodes and edges
  $x_1,e_1,x_2,e_2,\ldots,e_{k-1},x_k$ where $x_i \in V$ for $1 \le i
  \le k$ and $e_j \in \mathcal{E}$ for $1 \le j \le k-1$ is called a
  path from $u$ to $v$ if (i) $x_1 = u$ and $x_k = v$ and (ii) for $1
  \le j < k$, $x_j \in e_j$ and $x_{j+1} \in e_j$.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Given a hypergraph $G=(V,\mathcal{E})$ and two nodes $u,v \in V$
    we say that $u$ is connected to $v$ if there is path from $u$ to $v$.
    We say that a hypergraph is connected
    if each pair of nodes $u,v$ in $G$ are connected. Describe an algorithm that
    given a hypergraph $G$ checks whether $G$ is connected in linear time.
    In essense describe a reduction of this problem to the standard graph
    connectivity problem. You need to prove the correctness of your algorithm.
  \item Suppose we want to quickly spread a message from one person to
    another person during an emergency on a social network called
    AppsWhat which is organized as a collection of groups. Messages
    sent by a group member are broadcast to the entire group. AppsWhat
    knows the members and the list of groups on its service. The goal
    is to find the fewest messages that need to be sent such that a
    person $u$ can reach a person $v$. Model this problem using
    hypergraphs and describe a linear-time algorithm for it.
    No proof necessary for this part.

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a connected directed graph with non-negative
  edge lengths, let $s$ and $t$ be vertices of $G$. Suppose you
  computed the shortest path distances and a shortest path tree $T$
  from $s$ using Dijkstra's algorithm.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf Not to submit:} Suppose you only computed the shortest
    path distances and forgot to compute the tree $T$. Describe how
    you can compute a shortest path tree in linear time.
  \item After you did your shortest path computation you wanted to add
    a new edge $e=(u,v)$ with length $\ell(e)$ to your graph. Of
    course you can recompute the shortest path distances (and the tree) using Dijkstra's
    algorithm in the graph $H$ which is the graph obtained from $G$ by
    adding $(u,v)$. Describe a linear time algorithm that can do this
    without running Dijkstra's algorithm again. It may help you to see
    if the adding the edge would change any distances at all.
  \item Now consider the case when you want to delete an edge
    $e=(u,v)$ from the graph $G$. Describe a linear time algorithm that
    computes the new shortest path distances from $s$ in the graph $G-e$.
  \end{itemize}
  Briefly justify the correctness of your algorithms.

\begin{quote}
Since you are taking an algorithms class you decided to create a
  fun candy hunting game for Halloween. You set up a maze with one
  way streets that can be thought of as a directed graph
  $G=(V,E)$. Each node $v$ in the maze has $w(v)$ amount of candy
  located at $v$.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Each of your friends, starting at a given node $s$, has to
    figure out the maximum amount of candy they can collect. Note that
    candy at node $v$ can be collected only once even if the node $v$
    is visited again on the way to some other place.
  \item Your friends complain that they can collect more candy if they
    get to choose the starting node. You agree to their their request
    and ask them to maximize the amount of candy they can collect
    starting at any node they choose.
  \end{itemize}
  Before you ask your friends to solve the game you need to know how
  to do it yourself!  Describe efficient algorithms for both variants.
  Ideally your algorithm should run in linear time.
  {\em Hint:} Consider what happens if $G$ is strongly connected and
  if it is a DAG.

  No proof necessary if you use reductions to standard algorithms via
  graph transformations and simple steps. Otherwise you need to prove
  the correctness.
