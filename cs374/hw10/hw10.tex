Consider the language $$L_{\text{374H}} = \{ \langle M\rangle
      \mid M \text{~halts on at least 374 distinct input strings}\}.$$ Note that
      for $\langle M\rangle \in L_{\text{374H}}$, it is not necessary
      for $M$ to {\em accept} any string; it is sufficient for it to
      {\em halt} on (and possibly reject) $374$ different strings. Prove that
      $L_{\text{374H}}$ is undecidable.

\begin{quote}
We call an undirected graph an \emph{eight-graph} if it has
      an odd number of nodes, say $2n-1$, and consists of two cycles
      $C_1$ and $C_2$ on $n$ nodes each and $C_1$ and $C_2$ share
      exactly one node. See figure below for an eight-graph on $7$
      nodes.

  Given an undirected graph $G$ and an integer $k$, the EIGHT
  problem asks whether or not there exists a subgraph which is an eight-graph
  on $2k-1$ nodes. Prove that EIGHT is NP-Complete.

\begin{quote}
Given an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, a partition of $V$
  into $V_1,V_2,\ldots,V_k$ is said to be a clique cover of size $k$
  if each $V_i$ is a clique in $G$. CLIQUE-COVER is the following
  decision problem: given $G$ and integer $k$, does $G$ have a clique
  cover of size at most $k$?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Describe a polynomial-time reduction from CLIQUE-COVER to
    SAT. Does this prove that CLIQUE-COVER is NP-Complete? For this
    part you just need to describe the reduction clearly, no proof of
    correctness is necessary. {\em Hint:} Use variablex $x(u,i)$ to
    indicate that node $u$ is in partition $i$.
  \item Prove that CLIQUE-COVER is NP-Complete.
